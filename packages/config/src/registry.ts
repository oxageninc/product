// Canonical environment-variable registry — the single source of truth for
// "what every variable is, which deployable surfaces need it, where its value
// is kept, how to refresh it, and how it's documented."
//
// Everything else derives from this:
//   - `.env.example`            → `renderEnvExample()` (generated, never hand-edited)
//   - the build environment     → `tools/scripts/build-env.ts`
//   - local `.env.local` files  → `tools/scripts/env-pull.ts` (ADR-240)
//   - the static CI checker      → `tools/scripts/env-check.ts`
//   - the Architecture Atlas inventory → `tools/scripts/lib/archdocs/`
//
// Values live in SSM Parameter Store (ADR-240). This file says which variables
// exist and where each one's value is kept. It holds only the static values.
//
// The Zod `baseEnvSchema` (env.ts) remains the *runtime validator*; this registry
// is a documentation/deployment superset of it. A variable is "schema-validated"
// iff it appears in `baseEnvSchema` — computed by `isValidated()`, never a
// hand-maintained flag, so the two can't silently diverge. `registry.test.ts`
// asserts every schema key has a registry entry.
