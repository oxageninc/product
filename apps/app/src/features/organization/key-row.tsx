// The two cells of an API keys row that turn on time: Expires, with the
// key's state as a dot and a word, and the row's Rotate and Revoke.
//
// The page reads its keys once and the instant it read them travels with the
// rows. Both cells turn on that instant, and a page left open crosses an
// expiry without a reload, so both are judged against a clock that keeps
// running. Each cell runs the clock from the same captured instant and the
// same expiry, through the same `credentialState`, so the two cannot
// disagree: Rotate is never withdrawn while the status still says "live".
// The rest of the row is static and is drawn by the section
// (`api-keys.tsx`), which hands every cell to the shared list table.
//
// The clock itself is `@/ui/expiry-clock`, shared with the agent credential
// and host rows, which derive their own state from the same captured instant.
//
// This is the courtesy. `rotate_api_key` refuses an expired key and that
// refusal is the guarantee, on the API and MCP as well as here.
