// Agents › Mandates (#2957; mockup `aMandates`): the mandates this agent
// holds, and — when it holds none — what that means for a call that carries a
// consequence. Nothing in a role, a grant or a toolbelt substitutes for a
// mandate: a call carrying an impact with no mandate is denied before
// dispatch, before any credential is minted.
//
// The section reads `list_mandates` narrowed to the agent. A member without an
// accountable org role is not denied on that read: the handler narrows it to
// the agents that reader created and answers a successful, shorter list. So an
// empty answer means one of two things — the agent holds no mandate, or it
// holds mandates this reader may not see — and only an accountable reader can
// tell them apart. The "No mandate" state says a call carrying a consequence
// is denied before dispatch, which is a statement about the agent's authority
// and not about this list, so it is shown only to a reader whose answer covers
// every mandate. A truncated page is the second reason, and it bites the other
// way round: a hundred newer drafts can push the one mandate still in effect
// off a newest-first read, so rows are present and none of them authorize
// anything. `blindSpotOf` answers both from the evidence that still holds them
// — the reader's role and `truncatedAt` — because neither is visible in the
// rows. `blindSpotOf` asks "is this the whole set", not "is it empty", because
// incompleteness is a property of the answer and not of its length: a narrowed
// list of fifty rows is as partial as a narrowed list of none. So one line
// states what the answer is missing whenever anything is, above the rows and
// above the authority statement both, and every claim below it is read against
// it — the empty state declines to assert absence, and the table no longer
// implies it is everything the agent holds.
//
// A retired identity is not offered the request. Retirement archives the agent
// and suspends its principal, so a mandate granted after it can never be drawn
// — and neither `request_mandate` nor `grant_mandate` resolves that status
// (`resolveAgent` filters on `deletedAt`, which retirement does not set), so
// the write would succeed and put real authority in the ledger against an
// identity that can never run. The page declines to offer it and says why;
// closing it on the other surfaces is the handler's, and is filed as #3124.
//
// What a row must show is not this page's question to answer on its own. A
// mandate's scope and its per-measure accounting window are facts of the view
// model, and the Tools ledger had already dropped both and been corrected; this
// table dropped the same two independently. Two components re-projecting one
// view model and losing the same fields is a missing shared presentation, not
// two local bugs, so both now render through `MandateScope` and
// `MandateAuthorityList` in `@/ui` and the next table to show a mandate gets
// them without asking.
//
// A third fact went the same way. An `active` mandate whose `validFrom` is
// still ahead is granted and not yet usable — `isEffective` excludes it, the
// status column calls it active, and the empty state offered only "a request
// awaiting a decision, or history". Both readings were on screen at once. This
// table learned to say when such a row starts and the Tools ledger did not,
// and neither said when an active row's window had closed (#3152). The status
// cell now draws through `MandateStatus` in `@/ui`, which keeps the stored word
// and says under it when the window opens or closed, judged by `windowOf` at
// the answer's own instant. The empty state has a sentence for the upcoming
// case.
//
// The warning is driven by authority and not by row count. A draft, a revoked
// row and an expired one all authorize nothing, and `request_mandate` writes a
// draft — so a page that asked "are there rows?" would stop warning the moment
// an operator requested a mandate, which is the moment the agent still has
// none. The rows stay in the table, because the request and the history are
// what the office reads; only the claim about authority is theirs to make.
