// The Library's shelf row (roadmap pages/steering.md): All, Records,
// Instructions, Skills, Memory and Ontology, each with its count in a dim
// span and each carrying `aria-pressed`, inside a group named "Library
// shelves". Picking a shelf is a navigation, so a shelf has an address
// somebody can send and the back button walks the shelves; a chip is a link
// that also answers Space, as its button role promises (@/ui/press-link).
//
// Instructions renders only where the workspace has one. A shelf whose count
// has no read yet prints "not recorded" in place of a number, so All is the
// sum of the numbers beside it and never a guess at the rest. It renders on
// the Library alone: an artifact kind is not a peer of an assignment or a
// lifecycle.
