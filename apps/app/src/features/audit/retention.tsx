// Each segment prints what backs it and nothing stronger. Control-plane events
// are held seven years by the audit partition maintenance (ADR-125). The body
// retention is the longest window a pinned retention policy declares
// (get_evidence_retention), "not recorded" when none is pinned, and "unread"
// with the control plane's code when the read does not answer. The run
// ledger's retention has no record at all (#3878), so its segment says so
// instead of "forever".
